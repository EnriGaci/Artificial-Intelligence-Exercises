Do Pacman project P1 of (http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html)

Kind regard to berkeley university for providing me the necessary files for developing this exercise

Files I have edited search.py, searchAgents.py


python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=tinyMazeSearch

The command above tells the SearchAgent to use tinyMazeSearch as its search algorithm, which is implemented in search.py

Implement the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm in the depthFirstSearch function in search.py
